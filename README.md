Research on different models working with music. The music has two possible representations: time steps with each consisting of the pitch, duration of the held pitch, and offset. The second representation is a one hot encoding of the possible pitches where the difference in time between the time steps is a constant value (the smallest difference in the song). The models used vary from statistical to standard machine learning methods. The model we focus on however, are Tangled Program Graphs. The library we used is forked and changed to give back one action. We are also experimenting currently with curriculum learning, the training validation and testing schemes are based on the smoothness of the data. The methodology of the data division for TPG can be read here: https://ali-naqvi.ca/uploads/Towards_Creativity.pdf
