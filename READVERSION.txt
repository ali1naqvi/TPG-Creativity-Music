This version has the untouched pytpg to test what would happen with two continuous states 
I have also added recursion to occur for 50 percent of the training data
and finally, operators have been reduced to default rather than using full (cos, log, etc)

Using the first order difference: 
    pros: easier for it to recognize patterns. 
    cons:


DID NOT include priming for best agent

THOUGHTS: Instead of accumulating error with recursion and also using direct which might cause issues with actually
guessing. We can use recursion for each episode instead. Give it the initial state of that episode to start off and
then go off of that.
